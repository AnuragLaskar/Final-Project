"negative","true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at ."
"negative","doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago ."
"negative","the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours ."
"negative","kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious ."
"negative","the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due ."
"negative","queen of the damned is too long with too little going on ."
"negative","it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush ."
"negative","any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss ."
"negative",". . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves ."
"negative","the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing ."
"negative","though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful ."
"negative","in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian ."
"negative","feels strangely hollow at its emotional core ."
"negative","no surprises ."
"negative","you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal ."
"negative","the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view ."
"negative","this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera ."
"negative","characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle ."
"negative","the venezuelans say things like "" si , pretty much "" and "" por favor , go home "" when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of "" dragonfly . """
"negative","it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will ."
"negative","director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself ."
"negative","it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 ."
"negative","like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on"
"negative","as pedestrian as they come ."
"negative","a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen ."
"negative","it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary ."
"negative","put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work ."
"negative","more intellectually scary than dramatically involving ."
"negative","an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle ."
"negative","the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here ."
"negative","as saccharine as it is disposable ."
"negative","you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another ."
"negative","the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery ."
"negative","very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all ."
"negative","too much power , not enough puff ."
"negative","the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show ."
"negative","it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances ."
"negative","a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential ."
"negative","muddled , trashy and incompetent"
"negative","for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league ."
"negative","narc is all menace and atmosphere ."
"negative","though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore ."
"negative","despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs ."
"negative","it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing ."
"negative","his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it ."
"negative","it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead ."
"negative","a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving ."
"negative","there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them ."
"negative","as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction ."
"negative","the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie ."
"negative","enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid ."
